# Context {.unnumbered}

::: {style="text-align: center"}
**TBD**
:::

-   context for work, old existing AE, WB funding, etc.

-   Objective of this study

# Method

## Site selection

-   Describe how site selection helps to meet the objective

-   Describe link with NFI data to find big trees

-   ADD map of site locations

## Field work

-   Describe the measurements of plot variables, tree inventory and destructive sampling

-   Describe lab measurement

-   Describe math formulas to get aboveground dry mass from partial weight measurement in the field

-   ADD Photos

The method is destructive sampling but the approach is semi-destructive sampling, since big log where not weighted in the field.

## Allometric equation development

### General approach

1.  Data cleaning
    1.  Visualize the data and detect outliers.
    2.  Check the data and if necessary the field form, correct the data if data entry error.
    3.  Remove the outliers that would influence the models and are not frequent in the forest. For example, trees with large drop in stem profile, volume or biomass due to a low fork are not used in the model development.
2.  Model development
    1.  For non-linear models with Maximum Likelihood approach, get starting paramter values. Starting values can come from the scientific literature or from log-transformed linear models for power models.
    2.  Develop the model and test the effect of various category variables as random effect.
    3.  Use parameters significance (t-test) and visual checks to assess the models 'goodness of fit'. For a model type: ${Y}_{pred} = f\left(X\right)$ , with ${Y}_{obs} = {Y}_{pred} + res$ Visual check include the following 3 graphs:
        1.  ${Y}_{obs} = f\left({Y}_{pred}\right)$,

        2.  $res = f\left({Y}_{pred}\right)$, and

        3.  ${res}_{w} = f\left({Y}_{pred}\right)$,

            with ${res}_{w}$ the weighted residuals following the residual variance model ${res}_{w} = res/{X}^{c}$ and $c$ defined by $res \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^c\right)$ .
3.  Model selection:
    1.  Record the model **AIC** (Akaike Information Criteria) as a model performance indicator to compare models that have the same output variable.
    2.  Compare the models for each output variable. The model that have the best (i.e. lowest) AIC is selected. If such model has a random effect of a category variable, individual models for each category are developed.
    3.  Model validation.
        1.  Bias is the main validation criteria: $bias = \sum_k |{Y}_{pred} - {Y}_{obs}|$ and $bias\% = \sum_k |{Y}_{pred} - {Y}_{obs}| / {Y}_{obs}$.
        2.  (if times allows) Model efficiency: $ef = 1 - \frac{\sum_k ({Y}_{obs} - {Y}_{pred})^2}{\sum_k({Y}_{obs} - mean({Y}_{obs}))^2}$.
        3.  Cross validation, the datasets for each model development are split into $K$ folds.

### Non-linear vs log-transformed models

The AE development primarily relies on non-linear models with Maximum Likelihood approach, using the `nlme()` function from the R package {nlme}.

If one category variable improve the model (lower AIC with no visible defect from observation graphs), separate models are develop for each category (for example, species names).

Non-linear maximum likelihood models are preferred over log-transformed linear model for their ability to:

-   have additive residuals with a heteroscedasticity covered with a power model on the residuals' variance,

-   test random effect on all or part of the models' parameters to evaluate their impact.

## Models tested

List of volume models:

1.  $V = a.D^b$,
2.  $V = a.\text{D2H}^b$,
3.  $V = a.D^b.H^c$,

For the models with $\text{D2H} = D^2.H$ the variance model were tested with both $D$ and $D2H$ as input variable but $D$ systematically improved the models' AIC and therefore only those are presented.

On all models, the impact of the following categories were tested as random effects:

-   coniferous vs broadleaf

-   species group (6 species + one group for *Castonopsis* genus)

-   species (9 species)

### Model validation

Cross validation and comparison with literature models (See other models for Shorea Robusta, Bangladesh Thailand, pan-tropical model, Nepal historical models).
